# aoc

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions public repo made in Node.js and TypeScript. Tested on node version 18.12.1

### Use at your own risk

The `day-` folder structure should export two methods: `firstPart()` and `secondPart()` that should return the result of your computation. Why this? Pretty obvious if you know how AoC works.

```
export const firstPart = (): <your return type> => {

}

export const secondPart = (): <your return type> => {

}
```

Launch each day solution with the following command

```
$ yarn solve <year> <day>
```

For example, to see the solution for day 1 of 2022 you should launch

```
$ yarn solve 2022 1
```

### My rules

- I'm not going for "elegant" code or exotic language usages and I'll use `lodash` (and other libraries) if I need to. Don't reinvent the wheel!
- Everything in a single file, excluding input

### No shame if it works reasonably. üòâ
